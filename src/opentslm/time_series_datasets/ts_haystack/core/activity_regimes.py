Activity regime definitions for WillettsSpecific2018 label scheme.

Activities within the same regime have similar statistical properties
(variance, frequency content) in accelerometer signals, making them
appropriate as distractors for each other.

This module groups activities into two broad regimes:
1. Sedentary: Low movement intensity, low signal variance
2. Active: Significant movement, higher signal variance

Using two regimes (instead of more granular groupings) ensures sufficient
activities per group for meaningful distractor sampling.
